    <p>The alternative rock band currently has 4 studio albums and have sold over 10 million copies worldwide.</p>
    <p>The band has been compared to other bands such as Pink Floyd, The cure, and U2 because of their philosphical and spirtual lyrics.</p>
    <p>The name was taken from a rare manuscript 'Argus Apocraphex.' </p>
    <p>Jared has stated that its a rough translation and a metaphor for the future.</p>
    <p>Recorded the first album with Bob Ezrin( worked with Pink floyd, Kiss, and Alice cooper) and Brian Virtue. Before the album was completed the band went on tour with Puddle of Mudd.</p>
    <p>Before recording the third album in 2009 the band tried to change record labels causing EMI to sue them for 30 million dollars. This supposedly inspired the title of the album 'This is War.'</p>
    <p>The band released a documentry, directed by Jared, in 2012 called Artifact which followed the band through the lawsuit and recording.</p>
